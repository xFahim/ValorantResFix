# Basic
There is nothing fancy done here. Inside your AppData folder, there are some config files which contain some settings for the in-game resolution and other graphics properties. And you don't get to access these settings inside the game. So, in order to make changes to those settings, you can open those config files with a text-editor (notepad) and make these same changes. But using the application it could be done in a clean and robust manner; that's all. I hope that helps. 

# Download
